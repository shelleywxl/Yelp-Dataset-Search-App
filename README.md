# Yelp-Dataset-Search-App

This standalone Java application is designed to run queries on the Yelp data (from Yelp Academic Dataset). 

The primary users for this application will be potential customers seeking for businesses and users that match their search criteria. The application has a user interface that provides the user the available business categories (main, sub-categories), the attributes associated with each business category along with business review and yelp user information associated with each business category.

Faceted Search: In this application, the user can filter the search results using available attributes (i.e. facets) such as category, sub-category, attributes, reviews, stars and votes. Each time the user clicks on a facet value; the set of results is reduced to only the items that have that value. Additional clicks continue to narrow down the searchâ€” the previous facet values are remembered and applied again.
